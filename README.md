## 💡 Background

The core purpose of this project is to conduct an **AI Full-Stack Development Practice**. We are trying to answer the question: **Can current AI technology autonomously complete the writing and maintenance of a large-scale software system involving frontend, backend, data processing, and complex logic with minimal human intervention?**

Therefore, the majority of the work in this project, from architecture design and code writing to documentation, has been completed by AI.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The project is divided into three core parts, with the backend integrating various Agent paradigms (ReAct, Multi-Agent Debate, Master-Sub Agent) and frameworks (Google ADK, LangChain):

1.  **Frontend**: Responsible for data display and user interaction, providing a modern visualization interface.
2.  **Backend**: Responsible for data fetching, processing, and core Agent scheduling and orchestration.
3.  **Memory System**: An independent cognitive storage layer composed of short-term, medium-term, and long-term memory, designed to allow AI to form a long-term investment style and possess self-reflection capabilities.

## 🧩 Features

### 1. Home
The entry point of the project, providing intuitive market data display, including key information such as A-share market indices and sector fund flows, helping users quickly grasp the overall market sentiment.

### 2. Stock Analysis
A comprehensive deep scan of a single stock, including the following sub-modules:

*   **Market Review**: Displays basic stock information, where AI analyzes today's price movements and provides operational suggestions.

### 3. Macro Data
Real-time fetching of domestic and international core macroeconomic data (such as CPI, PPI, GDP, VIX, etc.), based on which AI analyzes the macroeconomic situation to assist in judging the direction of major asset allocation.

### 4. AI Council
Referencing the concept of a "One-Person Company," an advisory team composed of multiple AI roles (such as CEO, CTO, Chief Analyst, etc.) is built. Users ask questions, and multiple AIs perform their respective duties in a roundtable discussion, finally providing a comprehensive conclusion.

### 5. Memory Visualization
This is an exploratory highlight of the project. We expect AI not to be just a stateless Q&A machine but to form a long-term investment style.
*   **Reflection & Correction**: AI can review and reflect on historical decisions, correcting its own investment logic.
*   **Triple-Layer Memory**: Implemented a memory system consisting of Working Memory, Episodic Memory, and Semantic Memory.
*(Note: Currently only a few Agents are connected to this system)*

## 🛠️ Technical Exploration

This project has conducted extensive technical exploration in the development of backend Agents:

*   **Agent Paradigm Diversity**:
    *   **Single Agent ReAct**: Used for simple tool-calling tasks.
    *   **Multi-Agent Debate**: Used for multi-perspective discussion of complex issues (e.g., the Council).
    *   **Master-Sub Agent**: Used for task decomposition and distribution (e.g., Deep Research).
*   **Framework Attempts**:
    *   **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)**: Used to build standardized Agents.
    *   **LangChain**: Used for early prototype validation and partial toolchains.
    *   **Custom EventBus**: Implements decoupling and communication between modules.
